              not only utilizes the FDA verified dual mechanisms of gaming and
              giving to enhance mental wellbeing, but also incorporates time
              entrainment to dilate the player's perception of time. The network
              will discover the players who are most adept at slowing down time
              and the DAO will reward the community for the participation in the
              game.

              The major epiphany of web3 is that we can use computational logic
              to build anything we can dream. What has begun as a 2.5D game will
              evolve into a complete simulation of the planet, porting the
              blockchain economics along the way. In June 2021 I went to the
              Colorado mountains to collate my thoughts and pinpoint the
              feasibility of a global micro donation based game in a grandiose
              attempt to save the planet. What I can call a litepaper is a wide
              ranging write up incorporating my experience in technology,
              artificial intelligence, love of theoretical physics, philosophy
              and storytelling.

              In the year since, an idea that would seem dramatically grandiose
              is rapidly becoming even more feasible through exponetial
              convergence of technologies.

              Although 'a game to save humanity' may sound idealistic, the
              collation of science fiction and technology is happening all
              around us. Words and thoughts ultimately reveal the inevitability
              of this conclusion. Only by steering technology towards grandiose
              macro ends can humans optimistically face the coming challenges of
              the planet. We will utilize the funds from the THOUGHTS NFT
              collection to further Solidity development and the visual elements
              of the game with the aim of launching the beta front end in 2023.

              I have been working in various forms of emerging technology for
              over 2 decades and storytelling for even longer. I bought my first
              eth in July '17, subsequently gaining and losing money and belief
              a hundred times over. I could have kicked myself for my losses,
              but instead my experience forced me to really want to understand
              everything about the technology. So I dove deep into web3 and
              eventually had the epiphany we all share - the infinite promise. I
              understood that we are only limited by logic and realized an idea
              I had been working on for 15 years was made possible by the
              blockchain. In June 2021 I went to the Colorado mountains to
              collate my thoughts and pinpoint the feasibility of a global
              donation based game in a grandiose attempt to save the planet.
              What I can call a litepaper is a wide ranging write up
              incorporating my experience in technology, artificial
              intelligence, love of theoretical physics, philosophy and
              storytelling.

              In the year since, an idea that would seem far too grandiose is
              rapidly becoming even more feasible through converging
              technologies.

              You are living it now. What will you decide? I encourage you to
              read the Thoughts NFT launch and join those of us deconstructing
              time to see through this plane and onto the next stage of human
              evolution - all while helping those we can.
              <br />
              <br />
              Since the litepaper I've had the good fortune to continue working
              with some amazing minds and humanitarians to continue development
              of the prototype for Now the game. We will utilze the funds from
              the THOUGHTS NFT collection to further Solidity development and
              audits along with launching the beta front end towards the end of
              2022. For the DAO We will look to build off the emergent open
              source ecosystem to captialize on advances like CultDAO's push
              towards decentralization and - although the main purpose of the
              Game and DAO will be towards donations - we will also be looking
              at incorporating the latest innovations to become a small part of
              the overall UBI ecosystem.
              <br />
              <br />
              Again the NFT's, game and DAO all will initially funnel donations
              direct to
